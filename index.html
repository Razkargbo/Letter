<p>Re: Eileen Dover applying to college</p>
<p>Dear Eileen,
</p>
<p> Thank you for your recent application to join us at the Faculty of Science at Université Génialissime to <br>study for your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.
</p>
<p>Start dates
</p>
<p>We are happy that you can start your studies with us at any time, but we prefer that you start at the<br> beginning of a semester; the start dates for each semester are as follows:</p>

<p>First semester: September 9, 2016<br>
Second semester: January 15, 2017<br>
  Third semester: May 2, 2017 </p>
<p>Please let me know if this is right for you, and if so, which start date you prefer.<br>
  You can find more information about important university dates on our website.</p>

<p>Study subjects</p>
<p>In the Faculty of Genius Sciences, we have a great openness in research, as long as the subjects fall<br> within the field of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent and dedicated researcher, just the<br> kind of person we would like to have on our team. That said, among the ideas you submitted, the ones<br> that intrigued us the most are the following, in order of priority: </P>

<p>Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of resveratrol (C14H12O3).<br>
Measuring the effect on performance of funk bass players at temperatures above 30°C (86°F), when<br> audience size increases exponentially (effect from 3 × 103 increasing to 3 × 104.)<br>
Constructions in HTML and CSS for the representation of musical scores.
</p>

<p>Can you provide us with more information on each of these topics, including the <br>expected duration of the research, the staff and other resources needed, and anything else we should know? Thank you.</p>

<p>Please accept, Madam, the expression of my distinguished sentiments,
</p>

<p>Dr Eleanor Gaye<br>
